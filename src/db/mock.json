Following on the heels of Stress Science: Neuroendocrinology and Stress Consequences: Mental, Neuropsychological and Socioeconomic, this third derivative volume will provide a readily accessible and affordable compendium that explains the phenomenon of stress as it relates physically and mentally to war, conflict and disaster. The first section will be dedicated to study of the link between stress and various forms of conflict. Specific instances of conflict will be discussed - the Gulf wars, Korea, Hiroshima bombing, the Holocaust, 9/11, Northern Ireland, terrorism in general, torture. The second section will explore the stress impact of more general physical disasters such as airline and vehicle accidents, earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes. The final section will focus on the clinical relationship between conflict stress and various mental diseases – PTSD, suicide, disaster syndrome, etc – as well as the adverse impact of stress on human physical health in general. Comprised of about 100 top articles selected from Elsevier’s Encyclopedias of Stress, the volume will provide a valuable desk reference that will put relevant articles readily at the fingertips of all scientists who consider stress. Chapters offer impressive and unique scope with topics addressing the relationship between stress generated by war, conflict and disaster and various physical/mental disorders Richly illustrated with over 200 figures, dozens in color Articles carefully selected by one of the world’s most preeminent stress researchers and contributors represent the most outstanding scholarship in the field, with each chapter providing fully vetted and reliable expert knowledge",

        "description": "Excerpt from Wars of the Century and the Development of Military Science No account of the Nineteenth Century would be complete without a narrative of its wars which are not inferior in interest to any which History records. The campaigns of Napoleon are not only replete with instruction for the military student, but are full of striking dramatic incidents, and from the marvellous personality of the principal actor in them exercise a fascination over the mind of the reader independent of his sympathies. The War of Secession in America touches us nearly both from the science and heroism displayed in it, and from the fact that the two combatants were of the same race and language, while the great War of 1870 must remain fr-r many years the classical example of every branch of the military art.

        "description": "A “wide-ranging and sophisticated anthology” comparing theaters of war to wars in the movie theater (Dennis Showalter, author of Patton and Rommel). Why We Fought makes a powerful case that film can be as valuable a tool as primary documents for improving our understanding of the causes and consequences of war. A comprehensive look at war films, from depictions of the American Revolution to portrayals of September 11 and its aftermath, this volume contrasts recognized history and historical fiction with the versions appearing on the big screen. The text considers a selection of the pivotal war films of all time, including All Quiet on the Western Front, Sands of Iwo Jima, Apocalypse Now, Platoon, and Saving Private Ryan—revealing how film depictions of the country’s wars have shaped our values, politics, and culture, and offering a unique lens through which to view American history. Named as a Choice Outstanding Academic Title",

No knowledge of React is needed, though a working knowledge of ES2015 will help you follow along better. What You Will Learn Craft reusable React components Control navigation using the React Router to help keep your UI in sync with URLs Build isomorphic web applications using Node.js Use the Flexbox layout model to create responsive mobile designs Leverage the native APIs of Android and iOS to build engaging applications with React Native Respond to gestures in a way that's intuitive for the user Use Relay to build a unified data architecture for your React UIs In Detail React and React Native allow you to build cross-platform desktop and mobile applications using Facebook's innovative UI libraries. Combined with the Flux data architecture and Relay, you can now create powerful and feature-complete applications from just one code base! This book is split into three parts. The first part shows you how to start crafting composable UIs using React, from rendering with JSX and creating reusable components through to routing and creating isomorphic applications that run on Node. We then move on to showing you how to take the concepts of React and apply them to building Native UIs using React Native. You'll find out how to build responsive and streamlined UIs that can properly handle user interactions in a mobile environment. You'll also learn how to access device-specific APIs such as the geolocation API, and how to handle offline development with React Native. Finally, we'll tie all of these skills together and shows you how you can create React applications that run on every major platform. As well as understanding application state in depth, you'll learn how to leverage Relay to make feature-complete, data-driven web and native mobile applications. Style and approach Split into three major sections to help organize your learning, this hands-on, code-first book will help you get up to speed with React and React Native—the UI framework that powers Netflix, Yahoo, and Facebook.",

Get to know industry standard patterns as well as situational patterns. Decouple your application with these set of “Idea patterns”. Key FeaturesMobile development in React Native should be done in a reusable way. Learn how to build scalable applications using JavaScript patterns that are battle tested.Try effective techniques on your own using over 80 standalone examples.Book Description React Native helps developers reuse code across different mobile platforms like iOS and Android. This book will show you effective design patterns in the React Native world and will make you ready for professional development in big teams. The book will focus only on the patterns that are relevant to JavaScript, ECMAScript, React and React Native. However, you can successfully transfer a lot of the skills and techniques to other languages. I call them “Idea patterns”. This book will start with the most standard development patterns in React like component building patterns, styling patterns in React Native and then extend these patterns to your mobile application using real world practical examples. Each chapter comes with full, separate source code of applications that you can build and run on your phone. The book is also diving into architectural patterns. Especially how to adapt MVC to React environment. You will learn Flux architecture and how Redux is implementing it. Each approach will be presented with its pros and cons. You will learn how to work with external data sources using libraries like Redux thunk and Redux Saga. The end goal is the ability to recognize the best solution for a given problem for your next mobile application. What you will learnExplore the design Patterns in React NativeLearn the best practices for React Native developmentExplore common React patterns that are highly used within React Native developmentLearn to decouple components and use dependency injection in your applicationsExplore the best ways of fetching data from the backend systemsLearn the styling patterns and how to implement custom mobile designsExplore the best ways to organize your application code in big codebasesWho this book is for The ideal target audience for this book are people eager to learn React Native design patterns who already know the basics of JavaScript.

Or implement a complex multistep user action without writing messy code? How do you test your code? Make it reusable? Wire it to a backend? Keep it easy to understand? The React Cookbook delivers answers fast. Many books teach you how to get started, understand the framework, or use a component library with React, but very few provide examples to help you solve particular problems. This easy-to-use cookbook includes the example code developers need to unravel the most common problems when using React, categorized by topic area and problem. You'll learn how to: Build a single-page application in React using a rich UI Create progressive web applications that users can install and work with offline Integrate with backend services such as REST and GraphQL Automatically test for accessibility problems in your application Secure applications with fingerprints and security tokens using WebAuthn Deal with bugs and avoid common functional and performance problems",

        "description": "Do you want to make applications for Android and iOS ? Are you a developer who is bored of writing code for both Android and iOS ? In this series of books we will overcome the problem of having to write code for Android and iOS by using React Native. React Native is a framework developed by Facebook for creating native-style apps for iOS & Android under one common language, JavaScript. Initially, Facebook only developed React Native to support iOS. However with its recent support of the Android operating system, the library can now render mobile UIs for both platforms. Why React Native ? Not only react native allows you to create cross platform applications but react native also makes updating apps simple through over-the-app updates. Over the air update in react native is achieved through technologies such as CodePush with a few lines of code. Armed with React Native you’ll finally be able to make apps of your choice in no time and I’m glad to show you what React Native can do through this series of books. In this book we will learn the core concepts of Javascript to help us with our React Native Journey.",
